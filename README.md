# ðŸ§ª Noita-Inspired Falling Sand Simulator

A small experimental sandbox physics simulator inspired by *Noita*.  
Still in very early development â€” much more to come!

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Basic falling sand behavior
- Sand particles slide and stack to form hills
- Mouse-based particle spawning
- Grid-based simulation rendered with **GLFW** and **GLAD** (OpenGL)

## ðŸš§ Status

> ðŸ§ª Currently experimenting with GLAD/GLFW and sliding logic.  
> No sand yet.

## ðŸ›  Requirements

- C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, MSVC, etc.)
- [GLFW](https://www.glfw.org/) development libraries
- [GLAD](https://glad.dav1d.de/) OpenGL loader
- CMake (for building)
