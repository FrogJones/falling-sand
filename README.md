# ðŸ§ª Noita-Inspired Falling Sand Simulator

A small experimental sandbox physics simulator inspired by *Noita*.  
Still in very early development â€” much more to come!

## ðŸ”§ Features

- Basic falling sand behavior
- Sand particles slide and stack to form hills
- Mouse-based particle spawning
- Grid-based simulation rendered with SDL2

## ðŸš§ Status

> ðŸ§ª Currently experimenting with falling and sliding logic.  
> The system simulates sand piling realistically â€” but lots of features are still missing.

## ðŸ›  Requirements

- C++ compiler (GCC, Clang, etc.)
- [SDL2](https://www.libsdl.org/) development libraries
- CMake (for building)
